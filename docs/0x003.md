Hi again,


Surely you must’ve already heard the news that the application filed for the Bitcoin ETF-futures (Exchange Traded Funds) by the Winklevoss twins has been cancelled by the U.S. SEC.  

`
With Bitcoin Private, you’re entirely in control and embracing a bright new future with cryptocurrencies, join us and be at the forefront of the new era of digital currency usage.

###### — Matt Pass.


First of all, I'll try to explain some vital things related to *"The SEC"*.

These United States' regulatory agencies are fully aware that once this ETF door is ajar, it is going to create a flood of submissions and approvals, news and products, in every color & shade, specification & denomination connected to the crypto world. Their obvious evaluation would typically commence with *Who needs it?* Again they'd answer in unison - *The scammers, drug dealers, people who do not want and do not know how to work, or the ones who are hiding, and probably evading taxes.*

But, one may ask, *"How does the crypto-community view this situation around the ETFs?*
Put very simply, Bitcoin is not worthy of any regulations, approvals or confirmations at all! Now you might think that I’m just shilling on bcash -- No, you are wrong.
I had myself been invested in Bitcoin, until I discovered something more meaningful - **The Bitcoin Private.**
I’m already looking forward to how many whiners will be running FUD. Wait a minute.

## 1) The task of SEC is to protect investors.
Tell me, how can you protect investors when 116 addresses of wallets have 2/5 of all bitcoin? Why SEC approving should make someone richer in advance, no one knows maybe the owner of half of them is one person?? Bitcoin has future only if is these "big players" sell all the savings, considering that they are all already millionaires or billionaires - they would greatly facilitate the fate of Bitcoin.

But most likely this will not happen and every year people will first expect, and then wonder why comission does not support the initiative in setting legal regulations for crypto currency.

Here, on the contrary, we have a Bitcoin Private, which does not lobby the interests of a certain circle of people, is open to cryptocurrency community, as evidenced by numerous articles with a report on the resources spent by the team, voting on asic resistance and so on.

## 2) Overvalued Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks.
ETF futures are not just guessing on cards, or betting on sports. Here you need to put real money. And who with the SEC can promise that after obtaining permission old players will not start to pick up the price and that then there will be demand for bitcoin. Roughly speaking, if there is no demand, then who will buy bitcoin from those who used the etf tool is more expensive?

Another thing is when there is bitcoin with the code of the latest updates, in addition implemented by zk-snarks technology for 7$!!!!, holly f** dollars. 1000 times cheaper. Here it is very important to understand that a lot of investors are being led around by those 116, or less, owners of the biggest bitcoin wallets. My relatives, wake up, with such money you can buy experts, developers, members of the government, anyone! Buying everything except BTCP you behave like children, to whom they explained what is good, what is bad, but they are not yet able to analyze the information.

## 3) Distinctive features of other forks against Bitcoin.

Why Bitcoin, and not something else and if Bitcoin, why Private?

Jack Liao says, `Equihesh and decentralization.`
Roger says, `Block size, nothing more comes to mind.
Bitcoin Private - is not represented by one person, does not have people prepared in advance, everything that is built here - by the hands of the people themselves. Privacy protocol, rebase to bitcoin code, the possibility of implementing a private network lightning network. Who the hell told you that this is not a real Bitcoin? Definitely, choose only between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Private, confirmation in the next paragraph.

## 4) One more point, which sec must necessarily pay attention - activity on Github

GitHub activity is an interesting metric when analyzing ICOs and crypto projects. Developers’ time is a relatively expensive resource and if a given project has a lot of developers dedicating their time and skills it could mean several things:

These people believe that the project will be successful
The project is shipping more features
There is less probability the project is just an exit scam

Here you can evaluate the results of analysis of developer activity on Github:

261 stars vs 87 in Bcash. AND! Last time devs of BTCP are working day’n’night on code rebase.

Bcash — no activity since end of May.

## 5) Daily usage.

Bitcoin Private launched the project Cointigo.io which allows without Internet access to send BTCP via SMS.

And on July 31 BTCPPay, in which I see a great perspective, if this is supplemented by the creation of credit cards based on the blockchain.

Much like traditional payment processors, BTCP Pay offers cryptocurrency as a payment solution, which was always deemed to the use of the original Bitcoin and something we’re keen to make happen with Bitcoin Private. We safely, securely and privately handle payments through our blockchain, with speed, efficiency and extremely low cost, it’s incredibly quick and easy to setup in a variety of scenarios and both simple and fast for users to use. The customer never leaves your site and we store no personally identifiable information about your users or purchases, unless you want us to store this, again putting you in control.
